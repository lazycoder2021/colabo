NOTE NOTE NOTE!!!!!: for now, i am just pulling docs that match the status (ex: reviewed, under_review etc). they don't exactly belong to the person to whom the info is displayed. he just possesses the rights/privileges to act on the info. 

NOTE NOTE NOTE!!!: there is no separate status like review_completed (just under_review and pending_approval). So basically what's shown as review completed in the reviewer dashboard are docs with status completed.
